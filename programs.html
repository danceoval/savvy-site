      <h1>Empower your team, transform your business</h1>
      <p>Businesses will need to utilize AI to its fullest to stay competitive. World Economic Forum studies indicate that more than 75% of businesses expect to adopt AI in the next 5 years<sup>1</sup>. Yet, AI adoption among average American workers remains low: only 14% of American adults have ever tried ChatGPT, the gateway AI tool, for any purpose<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p>People-related factors are by far the biggest reason why digital transformation fails<sup>3</sup>. Savvy’s AI fluency programs are designed to turn distrust toward new technologies into inspiration while equipping employees with job-relevant skills that can be applied immediately, empowering them to do more with less, focus on the most rewarding aspects of their roles, and be the professionals of the future.</p>
