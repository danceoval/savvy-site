      <h1>Redefine the ways you operate today</h1>
      <p>A recent survey of LinkedIn’s Top Companies found that nearly 70% say AI is already helping them be faster and smarter. Companies will need to use AI to its fullest to stay competitive. </p>

      <p>Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI study shows that using AI boosts employee productivity and suggests that employees who use AI will replace those who don’t. Yet, AI adoption among average American workers remains low: only 14% of American adults have ever tried ChatGPT, the gateway AI tool, for any purpose.</p>

        <p>According to McKinsey research, people-related factors are by far the biggest reason why digital transformation fails. Chief among them are resistance to changes and the lack of ability to execute. <span class="highlight">Savvy’s AI fluency programs are designed to turn distrust into inspiration, build team capabilities, and accelerate AI adoption in your organization</span>.</p>
