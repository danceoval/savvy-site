      <h3>Dan Sohval</h3>
      <h4>Savvy AI Co-founder & Principal Instructor </h4>

    <div class="txt-right">
      <p>Hi! I am Dan. I started my journey as an educator more than a decade ago when I taught in Korea as a Fullbright scholar. Since then, I have been a principal software engineering instructor at Multiverse & Fullstack Academy and a curriculum designer at Kira Learning, Andrew Ng’s AI education start-up. I have taught over 800 students and pride myself in helping my learners lead successful careers and earn over 50 million dollars in combined salaries. </p>
      <p>
        I excel in delivering intricate technical topics in a manner that is engaging and easily accessible even to those without a technical background. I consider myself a solution engineer for my clients and learners, providing bespoke content and instruction to enable clients to achieve their business goals while facilitating the professional growth and advancement of my learners. This approach made me the top instructor in the Multiverse, an education company which is valued at $1.7B  with 400+ instructors, where I had an NPS of 95. My past clients include Google, Verizon, American Express, and McKinsey.

      <h3>Kevin Fauzie</h3>
      <h4>Savvy AI Co-founder & CEO </h4>

    <div class="txt-right">
      <p>Hello! I am Kevin. Growing up in a low-income family in rural Indonesia, my life changed when the internet came to my hometown and gave me access to educational resources that I otherwise would not have. I have since dedicated my career to empowering talent with the technology they need to achieve their greatest potential. </p>

      <p> I spent 5 years leading internal digital transformation efforts at Johnson & Johnson before getting my MBA at Stanford University, where I focused on entrepreneurship and business innovation. I met Dan while working at Multiverse as the product leader for its Strategic Analytics and Data Literacy programs which have a combined revenue of $40M+. There, I gained extensive knowledge in developing great corporate Learning & Development programs which I bring to Savvy AI. Using our L&D and business expertise, we are excited to design learning experiences that will equip your team with the skills to address your biggest business challenges head-on.
